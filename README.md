# Machine Learning
**Defination:** *Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.*

## Machine Learning 
*  **Supervised Learning:** Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from
 the input to the output.
*  **Unsupervised Learning:** Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables.

 ## 1.Data Preprocessing
* Data Preprocessing is  an importing step that needs to be done before implementing any machine learning model.
  * Importing the Libraries
  * Importing the datasets
  * Taking care of Missing data
  * Encoding categorical data
  * Splitting the data set into training set and test set
  * feature scaling
